            <strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong> is the standard
            markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web
            browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is
            often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
            and scripting languages such as JavaScript.
          </p>
          <p>
            Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local
            storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML
            describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally
            included cues for its appearance.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML
            constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may
            be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create
            structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such
            as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other items. HTML
            elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags
            such as &lt img &gt and &lt input &gt directly introduce content
            into the page. Other tags such as &lt p &gt and &lt /p &gt surround
            and provide information about document text and may include
            sub-element tags. Browsers do not display the HTML tags but use them
            to interpret the content of the page.
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as
            JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. The
            inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World
            Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current
            maintainer of the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over
            explicit presentational HTML since 1997.<sup>[2]</sup> A form of
            HTML, known as HTML5, is used to display video and audio, primarily
            using the &lt canvas &gt element, together with JavaScript.

          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>
            In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed
            and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and
            share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an
            Internet-based hypertext system.<sup>[3]</sup> Berners-Lee specified
            HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That
            year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau
            collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not
            formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee
            listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an
            encyclopedia is the first entry.<sup>[4]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            The first publicly available description of HTML was a document
            called "HTML Tags",<sup>[5]</sup> first mentioned on the Internet by
            Tim Berners-Lee in late 1991.<sup>[6][7]</sup> It describes 18
            elements comprising the initial, relatively simple design of HTML.
            Except for the hyperlink tag, these were strongly influenced by
            SGMLguid, an in-house Standard Generalized Markup Language
            (SGML)-based documentation format at CERN. Eleven of these elements
            still exist in HTML 4.<sup>[8]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            HTML is a markup language that web browsers use to interpret and
            compose text, images, and other material into visible or audible web
            pages. Default characteristics for every item of HTML markup are
            defined in the browser, and these characteristics can be altered or
            enhanced by the web page designer's additional use of CSS. Many of
            the text elements are mentioned in the 1988 ISO technical report TR
            9537 Techniques for using SGML, which describes the features of
            early text formatting languages such as that used by the RUNOFF
            command developed in the early 1960s for the CTSS (Compatible
            Time-Sharing System) operating system. These formatting commands
            were derived from the commands used by typesetters to manually
            format documents. However, the SGML concept of generalized markup is
            based on elements (nested annotated ranges with attributes) rather
            than merely print effects, with separate structure and markup. HTML
            has been progressively moved in this direction with CSS.
          </p>
          <p>
            Berners-Lee considered HTML to be an application of SGML. It was
            formally defined as such by the Internet Engineering Task Force
            (IETF) with the mid-1993 publication of the first proposal for an
            HTML specification, the "Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)" Internet
            Draft by Berners-Lee and Dan Connolly, which included an SGML
            Document type definition to define the syntax.<sup>[9][10]</sup> The
            draft expired after six months, but was notable for its
            acknowledgment of the NCSA Mosaic browser's custom tag for embedding
            in-line images, reflecting the IETF's philosophy of basing standards
            on successful prototypes. Similarly, Dave Raggett's competing
            Internet Draft, "HTML+ (Hypertext Markup Format)", from late 1993,
            suggested standardizing already-implemented features like tables and
            fill-out forms.<sup>[11]</sup>
          </p>
          <p>
            After the HTML and HTML+ drafts expired in early 1994, the IETF
            created an HTML Working Group. In 1995, this working group completed
            "HTML 2.0", the first HTML specification intended to be treated as a
            standard against which future implementations should be based.<sup
              >[12]</sup
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            Further development under the auspices of the IETF was stalled by
            competing interests. Since 1996, the HTML specifications have been
            maintained, with input from commercial software vendors, by the
            World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).<sup>[13]</sup> In 2000, HTML became
            an international standard (ISO/IEC 15445:2000). HTML 4.01 was
            published in late 1999, with further errata published through 2001.
            In 2004, development began on HTML5 in the Web Hypertext Application
            Technology Working Group (WHATWG), which became a joint deliverable
            with the W3C in 2008, and was completed and standardized on 28
            October 2014.<sup>[14]</sup>

          <h3>HTML version timeline</h3>
          <h4>HTML 2</h4>
          <h4>November 24, 1995</h4>
          <p>
            HTML 2.0 was published as RFC 1866. Supplemental RFCs added
            capabilities:<br />
            &bull;November 25, 1995: RFC 1867 (form-based file upload)<br />
            &bull;May 1996: RFC 1942 (tables) <br />
            &bull;August 1996: RFC 1980 (client-side image maps)<br />
            &bull;January 1997: RFC 2070 (internationalization)
          </p>
          <h4>HTML 3</h4>
          <h4>January 14, 1997</h4>
          <p>
            HTML 3.2<sup>[15]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It
            was the first version developed and standardized exclusively by the
            W3C, as the IETF had closed its HTML Working Group on September 12,
            1996.<sup>[16]</sup> Initially code-named "Wilbur",<sup>[17]</sup>
            HTML 3.2 dropped math formulas entirely, reconciled overlap among
            various proprietary extensions and adopted most of Netscape's visual
            markup tags. Netscape's blink element and Microsoft's marquee
            element were omitted due to a mutual agreement between the two
            companies.<sup>[13]</sup>
            A markup for mathematical formulas similar to that of HTML was
            standardized 14 months later in MathML.
          </p>

          <h4>HTML 4</h4>
          <h4>December 18, 1997</h4>
          <p>
            HTML 4.0<sup>[18]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It
            offers three variations:<br />
            &bull; Strict, in which deprecated elements are forbidden<br />
            &bull; Transitional, in which deprecated elements are allowed<br />
            &bull; Frameset, in which mostly only frame related elements are
            allowed.<br />
            Initially code-named "Cougar",<sup>[17]</sup> HTML 4.0 adopted many
            browser-specific element types and attributes, but also sought to
            phase out Netscape's visual markup features by marking them as
            deprecated in favor of style sheets. HTML 4 is an SGML application
            conforming to ISO 8879 – SGML.<sup>[19]</sup>
          </p>
          <h4>April 24, 1998</h4>
          <p>
            HTML 4.0<sup>[20]</sup> was reissued with minor edits without
            incrementing the version number.
          </p>
          <h4>December 24, 1999</h4>
          <p>
            HTML 4.01<sup>[21]</sup> was published as a W3C Recommendation. It
            offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and its last errata<sup
              >[22]</sup
            >
            were published on May 12, 2001.
          </p>
          <h4>May 2000</h4>
          <p>
            ISO/IEC 15445:2000<sup>[23]</sup> ("ISO HTML", based on HTML 4.01
            Strict) was published as an ISO/IEC international standard.<sup
              >[24]</sup
            >
            In the ISO, this standard is in the domain of the ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC
            34 (ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 34 – Document
            description and processing languages).<sup>[23]</sup> After HTML
            4.01, there were no new versions of HTML for many years, as the
            development of the parallel, XML-based language XHTML occupied the
            W3C's HTML Working Group.

          <p>
            HTML Tags,<sup>[6]</sup> an informal CERN document listing 18 HTML
            tags, was first mentioned in public.
          </p>

          <h4>June 1992</h4>
          <p>
            First informal draft of the HTML DTD,[33] with seven subsequent
            revisions (July 15, August 6, August 18, November 17, November 19,
            November 20, November 22)<sup>[34][35][36]</sup>
          </p>

          <h4>November 1992</h4>
          <p>
            HTML DTD 1.1 (the first with a version number, based on RCS
            revisions, which start with 1.1 rather than 1.0), an informal
            draft<sup>[36]</sup>
          </p>

          <h4>June 1993</h4>
          <p>
            Hypertext Markup Language<sup>[37]</sup> was published by the IETF
            IIIR Working Group as an Internet Draft (a rough proposal for a
            standard). It was replaced by a second version<sup>[38]</sup> one
            month later.
          </p>

          <h4>November 1993</h4>
          <p>
            HTML+ was published by the IETF as an Internet Draft and was a
            competing proposal to the Hypertext Markup Language draft. It
            expired in July 1994.<sup>[39]</sup>
          </p>

          <h4>November 1994</h4>
          <p>
            First draft (revision 00) of HTML 2.0 published by IETF itself[40]
            (called as "HTML 2.0" from revision 02<sup>[41]</sup> ), that
            finally led to the publication of RFC 1866 in November 1995.<sup

          <p>
            HTML 3.0<sup>[43]</sup> was proposed as a standard to the IETF, but
            the proposal expired five months later (28 September 1995)<sup

            without further action. It included many of the capabilities that
            were in Raggett's HTML+ proposal, such as support for tables, text
            flow around figures, and the display of complex mathematical
            formulas.<sup>[44]</sup> W3C began development of its own Arena

              >[45][46][47]</sup
            >
            but HTML 3.0 did not succeed for several reasons. The draft was
            considered very large at 150 pages and the pace of browser
            development, as well as the number of interested parties, had
            outstripped the resources of the IETF.<sup>[13]</sup> Browser
            vendors, including Microsoft and Netscape at the time, chose to
            implement different subsets of HTML 3's draft features as well as to
            introduce their own extensions to it.<sup>[13]</sup> (See browser
            wars.) These included extensions to control stylistic aspects of
            documents, contrary to the "belief [of the academic engineering
            community] that such things as text color, background texture, font
            size, and font face were definitely outside the scope of a language
            when their only intent was to specify how a document would be
            organized."<sup>[13]</sup> Dave Raggett, who has been a W3C Fellow
            for many years, has commented for example: "To a certain extent,
            Microsoft built its business on the Web by extending HTML
            features."<sup>[13]</sup>

          <h4>January 2008</h4>
          <p>
            HTML5 was published as a Working Draft by the W3C.<sup>[48]</sup>
            Although its syntax closely resembles that of SGML, HTML5 has
            abandoned any attempt to be an SGML application and has explicitly
            defined its own "html" serialization, in addition to an alternative
            XML-based XHTML5 serialization.<sup>[49]</sup>
          </p>

          <h4>2011 HTML5 – Last Call</h4>
          <p>
            On 14 February 2011, the W3C extended the charter of its HTML
            Working Group with clear milestones for HTML5. In May 2011, the
            working group advanced HTML5 to "Last Call", an invitation to
            communities inside and outside W3C to confirm the technical
            soundness of the specification. The W3C developed a comprehensive
            test suite to achieve broad interoperability for the full
            specification by 2014, which was the target date for
            recommendation.<sup>[50]</sup> In January 2011, the WHATWG renamed
            its "HTML5" living standard to "HTML". The W3C nevertheless
            continues its project to release HTML5.<sup>[51]</sup>
          </p>

          <h4>2012 HTML5 – Candidate Recommendation</h4>
          <p>
            In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C
            will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single
            definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The
            WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living
            Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never
            complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can
            be added but functionality will not be removed.<sup>[52]</sup> In
            December 2012, W3C designated HTML5 as a Candidate
            Recommendation.<sup>[53]</sup> The criterion for advancement to W3C
            Recommendation is "two 100% complete and fully interoperable
            implementations".<sup>[54]</sup>
          </p>

          <h4>2014 HTML5</h4>
          <p>
            In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation.<sup
              >[55]</sup
            >
            On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C
            Recommendation,<sup>[56]</sup> meaning the specification process is
            complete.<sup>[57]</sup>
          </p>
          <h4>XHTML versions</h4>
          <p style="font-style: italic">
            Main article:
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML">XHTML</a>
          </p>
          <p>
            XHTML is a separate language that began as a reformulation of HTML
            4.01 using XML 1.0. It is now referred to as the XML syntax for HTML
            and is no longer being developed as a separate standard.<sup
              >[58]</sup
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            &bull; XHTML 1.0 was published as a W3C Recommendation on January
            26, 2000,<sup>[59]</sup> and was later revised and republished on
            August 1, 2002. It offers the same three variations as HTML 4.0 and
            4.01, reformulated in XML, with minor restrictions.<br />
            &bull; XHTML 1.1<sup>[60]</sup> was published as a W3C
            Recommendation on May 31, 2001. It is based on XHTML 1.0 Strict, but
            includes minor changes, can be customized, and is reformulated using
            modules in the W3C recommendation "Modularization of XHTML", which
            was published on April 10, 2001.<sup>[61]</sup><br />
            &bull; XHTML 2.0 was a working draft. Work on it was abandoned in
            2009 in favor of work on HTML5 and XHTML5.<sup>[62][63][64]</sup>
            XHTML 2.0 was incompatible with XHTML 1.x and, therefore, would be
            more accurately characterized as an XHTML-inspired new language than
            an update to XHTML 1.x.

          <p>
            On 28 May 2019, the W3C announced that WHATWG would be the sole
            publisher of the HTML and DOM standards.<sup>[65][66][67][68]</sup>
            The W3C and WHATWG had been publishing competing standards since
            2012. While the W3C standard was identical to the WHATWG in 2007 the
            standards have since progressively diverged due to different design
            decisions.<sup>[69]</sup> The WHATWG "Living Standard" had been the
            de facto web standard for some time.<sup>[70]</sup>
